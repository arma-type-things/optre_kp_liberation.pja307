# OPTRE Liberation Dariyah

Uses KP Liberation v0.96.7a

This was based on [this mission in the workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1331079949); we wanted to use it for our server, but it was woefully outdated with regard to KP Liberation features. A little bit of work and it is now useable.

Out of respect to the original authors, we will not publish this to the workshop.

## How to use
Clone the repository, ensuring you do not rename the created folder and copy the folder to your `mpmissions` location. Or, if you prefer, use a tool such as PBO maker to create a PBO file from the folder and copy that to `mpmissions` instead.

You will need the following mods:

- CBA_A3 (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450814997)
